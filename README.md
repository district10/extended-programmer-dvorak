#### New Geometry: (uppercase letters remaped)
```
     ; , . U F Y g c L P
     a o e I H d R t n s
     ' q j k x b m w v z
```

#### Why?
First, see [English Letter Frequency Counts](http://norvig.com/mayzner.html),
the mostly frequently used letters are:
`e, t; a, o, i, n; s, r, h, l; d, c, u, m; f, p, ...`

On remapped letters:
 - R: 'r' should be in the home row;
 - H: 'h' was pushed aside by 'r', for easy type the most frequent "th" bigram, i put it on the left, and "wh" is easier too;
 - I: 'i' was happily set under left index finger;
 - F: what follows 'f' are often not vowels, instead they are consonents, it should be on the left;
 - Y, P: they don't deserve a good place, put them like in qwerty


 - 'u' moved up, 'l' moved left, easy to remember, easy to get along.
 - 'y', 'p', i don't like them
 - 'h', 'r', on where they should be
 - 'f', it should be put on the left

#### More custom:
I prety like [xcape](), with it you can do some migic like make <Alt_R> another <Return> without losing it's composing behavior
I use it to make:
Alt_L    ->  Tab
Alt_R    ->  Return
in bash/zsh: `xcape -e "Alt_L=Tab;Alt_R=Return"`
